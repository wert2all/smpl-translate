# SmplTranslate

SmplTranslate is a minimalist translation application built with [Angular](https://angular.dev/). The goal of this project is to provide a simple, fast, and intuitive interface for translating text. It features a clean, uncluttered UI and supports keyboard shortcuts for a more efficient workflow. The application is designed to be straightforward, focusing on the core functionality of translation without unnecessary distractions.

## Features

- **Real-time Translation:** Get instant translations as you type.
- **Multiple Language Support:** Switch between different languages seamlessly.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts:** Use keyboard shortcuts for quick and easy navigation and translation.
- **Vim-inspired Modes:** Switch between "insert" and "normal" modes for a more efficient workflow.
- **Clean and Simple UI:** A minimalist design that focuses on the core functionality of translation.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
